    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

    "Based on our notebook, to ensure that our LLM always responded the same way to our outputs, we are using a custom class \"ChatOpenAI\" which abstracts the API calls to the OpenAI GPT model, and 'run' is responsible for executing the API call and returning a response. The if statements within this class play a critical role in controlling the logic of how the class processes and responds to input. Our if statements serve several important purposes. They ensure that given the same input and state, the model's output is consistent and predictable. We use our if statements to execute different code paths based on conditions being met as well as to control the flow of the execution. We can also use the if statements to detect and handle errors gracefully and to determine which responses are appropriate based on the conversation context of the user's input. Our prompts are carefully crafted to control the context provided, and the if statements help to maintain the desired level of consistency/control over the models output."
